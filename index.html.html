  <h2>a little about me</h2>

  <p class="intro" style="background-color:#feb50f;">For the past 6 years I have been in the social work field, mainly as a case manager connecting people to needed resources, providing emotional support, and assisting and advocating for folks with the overwhelm of navigating the different systems and agencies.  I have found myself ready to explore other avenues of work other than social work, eager to use my creativity and learn something new.  I'm taking this course to dip my piggies into the big pond of software/web development to see if it sparks joy in me before I take the deep dive into committing to the path of the developer!
